# Jupiterp API v0 Docs (pre-release)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Jupiterp API, a free and open-source API to get detailed course data for the University of Maryland. Currently, the API is in pre-release phase and is unstable; expect breaking changes, but the information in these docs should be correct and up-to-date.

For any questions or bugs, please contact [admin@jupiterp.com](mailto:admin@jupiterp.com).

Feel free to view or contribute to the project [on GitHub](https://www.github.com/jupiterp-umd/api).

## Endpoints

### `/v0/`

This is the base endpoint for v0 of the Jupiterp API. It will simply return a HTTP StatusOK with some text to indicate that the Jupiterp API is online.
